    "content": " Certainly! Below is an example of how you can implement the Binary Search algorithm in Rust:\n\n```rust\nfn binary_search(arr: &[i32], target: i32) -> Option<usize> {\n    let mut left = 0;\n    let mut right = arr.len();\n\n    while left < right {\n        let mid = (left + right) / 2;\n        if arr[mid] == target {\n            return Some(mid);\n        } else if arr[mid] < target {\n            left = mid + 1;\n        } else {\n            right = mid;\n        }\n    }\n\n    None\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];\n    let target = 5;\n\n    match binary_search(&arr, target) {\n        Some(index) => println!(\"Target {} found at index {}\", target, index),\n        None => println!(\"Target {} not found\", target),\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The `binary_search` function takes a slice of integers (`arr`) and a target integer (`target`), both of which are of type `i32`. It returns an `Option<usize>` indicating the index of the target if found, or `None` otherwise.\n2. **Initialization**: \n   - `left` is initialized to 0 (start of the array).\n   - `right` is initialized to the length of the array.\n3. **Loop**: The loop continues as long as `left` is less than `right`.\n   - Calculate the middle index (`mid`) using integer division.\n   - If the element at `mid` is equal to the target, return the index `Some(mid)`.\n   - If the element at `mid` is less than the target, update `left` to `mid + 1`.\n   - If the element at `mid` is greater than the target, update `right` to `mid`.\n4. **Return**: If the loop completes without finding the target, return `None`.\n5. **Main Function**: Demonstrates how to use the `binary_search` function with an example array and a target value.\n\nThis code will output:\n```\nTarget 5 found at index 4\n```",
